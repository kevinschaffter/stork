# Code Review

Please perform a thorough code review of $ARGUMENTS. Focus on:

## Security Analysis
- Check for potential security vulnerabilities
- Verify input validation and sanitization
- Review authentication and authorization logic
- Look for exposed secrets or sensitive data

## Performance Review
- Identify potential performance bottlenecks
- Check for inefficient algorithms or data structures
- Review database queries and API calls
- Look for memory leaks or resource management issues

## Code Quality
- Verify TypeScript best practices
- Check for proper error handling
- Review code organization and modularity
- Ensure consistent naming conventions
- Verify proper type safety (no `any` types)

## Documentation
- Ensure code is self-documenting
- Check for necessary comments
- Verify API documentation is updated

Please provide specific suggestions for improvements with file and line references where applicable.
